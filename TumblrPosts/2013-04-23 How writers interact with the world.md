Matthew Battles has an engaging and informative blog post in the New York Times titled [How Writers Interact With the World](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/how-writers-interact-with-the-world/).

The post helped me think about writing, but one of the comments (reproduced below) on this post made me laugh and think about the specific activity and results of writing.

	You don't do 'data entry' on a manual Underwood. You just type on
	old-fashioned paper. And when you're done, it doesn't matter how
	many keys you push, it won't tell you a thing. It just sits there
	like a cat and stares at you.
