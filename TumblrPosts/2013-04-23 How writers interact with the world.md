Matthew Battles has an engaging and informative blog post in the New York Times titled [How Writers Interact With the World](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/how-writers-interact-with-the-world/).  

The post helped me think about writing, but one of the comments (reproduced below) on this post made me laugh and think about the specific activity and results of writing.  
```
	You don't do 'data entry' on a manual Underwood. You just type on
	old-fashioned paper. And when you're done, it doesn't matter how
	many keys you push, it won't tell you a thing. It just sits there
	like a cat and stares at you.
