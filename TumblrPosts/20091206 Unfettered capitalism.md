In a [letter to the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/letters/2009/12/07/091207mama_mail4) on a review of a biography of Ayn Rand, Lisa Turner writes, "[C]apitalism, in its most extreme form, is the mirror image of Communismâ€”cold, inhuman, inhumane, intractably greedy, and full of contempt for the individual, as well as for societal ideals as a whole." I agree.
