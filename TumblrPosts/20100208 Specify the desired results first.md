In Twitter I recently received the following quote attributed to Tom Gilb from 1988: "We are constantly making the mistake of specifying the means of doing something, rather than result we want." This is a refreshing reminder of how easy it is for me to jump into problem solving before the problem or end goal is sufficiently understood. Focusing on the result helps planning and decision making. Results-oriented development is a key property of agile and kanban system development approaches.
