From [Emergency Measures](http://www.narrativemagazine.com/node/104518) by James Richardson

```

	I take Saturdayâ€™s unpopulated trains,
	sitting at uncontagious distances,
	change at junctions of low body count, in off-hours,
	and on national holidays especially, shun stadia
	and other zones of efficient kill ratio,
	since there is no safety anymore in numbers.
